# godot-tips-and-tricks
Tips and tricks you should know when using Godot Engine!

Tips and tricks are listed in [the issues pages](https://github.com/me2beats/godot-tips-and-tricks/issues)

- read some tips/tricks 
- like the tip/trick if you find it useful 
- suggest improvements in comments
- create a tip/trick you would like to share 
  - use English
  - make it short and clear 
  - don't repeat existing tips/tricks
  - do not create several loosely related tips in one issue / post (like the trick I learned today). Instead, create some tips. Also you can link other tips (like "see also ")
  - on the other hand, if the problem has several similar solutions, it is recommended to describe / list them in one poster.
  - it is also recommended to create 1 poster if it solves several different problems, instead of duplicating the same solution for several problems in different posters. Just list these problems in one issue.
  - attach images and videos if it makes the tip/trick clearer 
  - links can be added; don't attach only links, describe the tip/trick.
  - add timecodes to video links (not necessary but preffered)
  - be polite 
  - note: tips/tricks can be closed/removed, main reasons:
    - the issue is not a tip/trick 
    - there are better solutions 
    - the tip/trick author insults someone or calls for illegal and unethical actions.

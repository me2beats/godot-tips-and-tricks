Tips and tricks you should know when using Godot Engine!

tips and tricks are here: https://github.com/me2beats/godot-tips-and-tricks/issues

- read some tips/tricks 
- like the tip/trick if you find it useful 
- suggest improvements in comments
- create a tip/trick you would like to share 
  - use English
  - make is short and clear 
  - don't repeat existing tips/tricks
  - be polite 
  - attach images and videos if it makes the tip/trick clearer 
  - note: tips/tricks can be closed/removed, main reasons:
    - the issue is not a tip/trick 
    - there are better solutions 
    - the tip/trick author insults someone or calls for illegal and unethical actions, behaves bad.
  - links can be added; don't attach only links, describe the tip/trick.
  - add timecodes to video links (not necessary but preffered)

Will be added soon:

- - labels 
- - tips/tricks
